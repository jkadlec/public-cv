\section{Summary}
\cvline{}{I'm a pragmatic software engineer with solid \textbf{computer science} background. My strongest skills are \textbf{Python, C and Go} programming, expert knowledge of \textbf{computer networks} and experience in natural language processing (\textbf{NLP}). 6 years of industry experience, out of which 2 were part-time.}

\section{Experience}

\cventry{3/2016--6/2016}{Tech Entrepreneur}{Entrepreneur First}{London, UK}{}{
Entrepreneur First is Europe's leading tech startup accelerator. Members are selected purely for their (technical) talents. I've explored two ideas at EF: measuring employee happiness from their mails and chats (technologies used: Python, NTLK, gensim, scikit-learn) and a smart testing solution for mobile devices (technologies used: Python, OpenCV, scikit-image).}

\cventry{4/2015--Present}{Lead Developer}{Phonexia}{Brno, CZ}{}{
Phonexia is a spin-off company of Brno University of Technology, and is a leading provider of speech technologies. I joined to create a new SaaS machine learning product, the main focus being making corporate meetings more efficient, but the platform was modular to allow for different scenarios. Most of the solution was written in Python using Flask, some parts like realtime streaming support were written in Go. Data storage used MySQL, Redis and Elasticsearch. The project used a microservice architecture, with each service dockerized. Used NLP libraries such as NLTK and gensim to analyse automatic transcriptions.
}

\cventry{10/2010--4/2015}{Software engineer}{CZ.NIC Labs}{Prague, CZ}{}{
I was one of the first employees of the CZ.NIC's Research and Development branch. CZ.NIC is the body governing the .cz domain. I was part of the Knot DNS project - an open source authoritative name server. At this time it is deployed at several root zone nodes, which makes it an important part of today's Internet infrastructure. My tasks included creating highly optimized multithreaded code in C and writing functional tests in Python. Most of the code I've written is still in production. I was also in charge of DNS and DNSSEC tutorials at CZ.NIC's Academy.
